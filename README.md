# **MultiTest**  
*A comprehensive Minetest launcher with global configs, instance management, and enhanced mod support.*

## **Features:**

- **Global Configurations**: Manage settings across multiple instances from a single global configuration file.
- **Instance Management**: Easily create, modify, and manage multiple Minetest instances.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for managing all aspects of your Minetest experience.

## **TODO:**

- Refactor `settings.py` to use the `configparser` library for configuration management.
- Split `instance_manager.py` into multiple smaller files, with each file handling a specific class.
- Add ContentDB support to allow adding mods directly from the mod configuration menu.
- Find someone on linux willing to help out with adding support for basic Ubuntu and maybe a couple other OSes.
